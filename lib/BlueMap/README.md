# BlueMap

This is a TypeScript port of the files found here:
https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/tree/master/BlueMapCommon/webapp

## Notes

- BlueMap is under the MIT license, so this is ok.
- You can see me just getting even more tired of doing some of the porting, so at some point I just stopped making type definitions for some of the more repetitive files.
